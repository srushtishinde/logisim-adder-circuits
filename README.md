# logisim-adder-circuits
This repository contains logisim half adder and full adder cicruits
To find the truth table of the built circuits, follow the given steps: 
1.Open logisim, and construct the circuit.
2.Choose option Project from the title bar. 
3.After selecting on project, choose analyze circuit
4.Choose Table, and you will find the truth table for logisim circuit you have constructed. 
*Note: In-built circuits cannot be analyzed.*
Use this method to refer if your built circuits are correct or not.
